Introduction
============

This is the core code for displaying messages in a `GroupServer`_ group. This module supplies two things:

* Some help (``gs-group-messages-help``), and
* A JavaScript viewlet (``gs-group-messages-base-script``) that appears on
  the group page [#groupPage]_ and is shared by the messages products that
  appear on the group page [#others]_.

.. [#groupPage] ``gs.group.home``
.. [#others] ``gs.group.messages.files``, ``gs.group.messages.posts``, and
             ``gs.group.messages.topics``.
.. _GroupServer: http://groupserver.org/
