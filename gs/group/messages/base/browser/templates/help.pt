  <h2>Messages</h2>
  <p>
    Messages are the core of a GroupServer group.
    A group member can add a post to a group using the Web or by email.
    When the member does this the post is displayed in a 
    <a href="#gs-group-messages-topic">topic</a>.
    This topic is common to all posts with the same name.
    However, a <a href="#gs-group-messages-post">post</a> can also be
    seen on its own page.
    <a href="#gs-group-messages-image">Images</a> that are added to the 
    group are shown on their own page.    
  </p>
  <p>
    The visibility of messages in a group is detailed in
    <a href="#gs-group-messages-privacy">the table below.</a>
